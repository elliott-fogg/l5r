# To Do

* Add Malleable Titles (titles that are customised) to Advantages
* Add requirements to Advantages (just like inputs, which will affect whether or 
not they show up in the Advantages list).
Note: They will need to be forcibly removed if their dependencies are no longer 
met (e.g. their prerequisite Advantage is removed). Could let user know through 
an Alert / Confirm?
* Add in an "Effects" system, so that effects can be attached to Advantages and 
other attributes through attributes (e.g. trait-cost_Earth)
* Add Tags to Advantages so they can be shown at appropriate times (e.g. if you
are making a Courtier Roll, and one of your Advantages is tagged with 
skill_Courtier, the advantage could be displayed nearby).


* Implement Spell Choices limits, add necessary information to Schools
* Implement '* No starting character may begin play with Trait or Skill above 
Rank 4.'


## Next Phase
* Implement Skill Mastery Abilities
* Save data to file, load data from file (optional)
* Allow creation of custom data items (Skills, Families, Clans, Spells, Gear)


## Eventually
* Convert text inputs to textbox inputs in Advantages.json and
Disadvantages.json, when necessary
* Create a system to apply effects (e.g. Ronin)
* Add ability to select Equipment
* Add ability to choose different school skills at different ranks
* Finish Dark Mode


## Once Migrated to Custom Website
* Add system that allows people to save their characters to the server.
* Add in system that allows James to look at everyone's character.
* Add in a more generalised system that allows someone to create an Admin 
account, and other users to hook up to that Admin account so the Admin can view
their characters.


## Notes:
* TN to be hit is normally 5 * Reflexes + 5
